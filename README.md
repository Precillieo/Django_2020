This is a repo for the Tanzania AI lab hackathon 2020 & the AI4Dev2020 challenge, where we as the Elixir team created the 1st AI based cancer diagnosis system, built a model comprising of Deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a web app that screens microscopic images so as to detect cancer tumors, thus increasing speed, accuracy in cancer diagnosis, and testing.
